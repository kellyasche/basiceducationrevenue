<h1>Description</h1>
<p>A school district receives $13 per pupil unit for gifted and talented
programming. $13 X adjusted pupil units. Must be spent on gifted and

2b.Gifted and talented revenue.</a></p>
<p>Gifted and talented revenue for each district equals the district’s
adjusted pupil units for that school year times $13. A school district
must reserve gifted and talented revenue and, consistent with section <a
href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/120B.15">120B.15</a>,
must spend the revenue only to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>identify gifted and talented students;</li>
<li>provide education programs for gifted and talented students; or</li>
<li>provide staff development to prepare teachers to best meet the
unique needs of gifted and talented students.</li>
</ol>

</div>
<div id="section-data" class="section level1">
<h1>Data</h1>
<p>The data being used is for FY22 since that is the last full,
“official” data we have available.</p>
<p>Gifted and talented revenue is a horizontal funding mechanism. It is
distributed on a per student basis. In this case, a school receives $13
for every adjusted pupil unit (APU).</p>
<p>The below provides the APU, total gifted and talented revenue, as
well as the gifted and talented revenue per APU for each district. As
expected, the gifted and talented revenue per APU is $13.00 for every
district.</p>
