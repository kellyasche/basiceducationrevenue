# Description

Operating capital revenue must be reserved and used for equipment and facility needs. The computation is, the sum of $79 per pupil unit and the product of $109 per pupil unit and the districtâ€™s average building age index. The age index is called the maintenance cost index (MCI) and is calculated as follows;

* MCI = (weighted square footage of buildings) / (Unweighted square footage of buildings)
* The weighted square food is the bildings square footage times the lesser of 1.5 or the sum of 1 + (the age of each building or addition / 100).
		
Operating capital revenue is provided through an equalized aid and levy and is computed as follows

* Operating capital revenue - [$79 + (MCI x $109)] x adjusted pupil units
* Operating capital levy = Operating capital revenue x the less of 1 or (adjusted net tax capacity /Adjusted Pupil Units) / $23,885
* Operating capital aid = Operating Capital Revenue - Operating Capital Levy

# State Legislation
[Subd. 13.Total operating capital revenue.](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/126C.10#stat.126C.10.13)
 
a) Total operating capital revenue for a district equals the amount determined under paragraph (b) or (c), plus $79 times the adjusted pupil units for the school year. The revenue must be placed in a reserved account in the general fund and may only be used according to subdivision 14.
b) Capital revenue for a district equals $109 times the district's maintenance cost index times its adjusted pupil units for the school year.
c) The revenue for a district that operates a program under section 124D.128, is increased by an amount equal to $31 times the number of adjusted pupil units served at the site where the program is implemented.

[Subd. 13a.Operating capital levy.](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/126C.10#stat.126C.10.13a)
 
To obtain operating capital revenue, a district may levy an amount not more than the product of its operating capital revenue for the fiscal year times the lesser of one or the ratio of its adjusted net tax capacity per adjusted pupil unit to the operating capital equalizing factor. The operating capital equalizing factor equals $23,902 for fiscal year 2020, $23,885 for fiscal year 2021, and $22,912 for fiscal year 2022 and later.

[Subd. 13b.Operating capital aid.](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/126C.10#stat.126C.10.13b)
 
A district's operating capital aid equals its operating capital revenue minus its operating capital levy times the ratio of the actual amount levied to the permitted levy.

# Data

Operating capital aid is an equalization funding mechanism. It's broken into a few different parts - revenue, levy, and aid. These are the main variables in the dataset that represent each part.

* Operating capital revenue: ocexrev
* Operating capital levy: cexlvy
* Operating capital aid: cexaid



**Operating capital revenue**

The operating capital revenue provides revenue for adjusted pupil units as well as a bit extra for pupils that participate in programs outside of normal classroom programming (i.e. summer school).

*ocexrev*

To get the value of this column you calculate the following;

cxfrev = awadm22 x (79 + (109 x ageidx22))

* awadm22 = adjusted pupil units
* ageidx22 = maintenance cost index

Then, we need to add the extra $31 for each pupil unit that participates in programs outside of normal classroom hours (i.e. summer school).

ocexrev = cxfrev + (31 x ywadm22)

* ywadm22 = adusted pupil units for extended learning students

**Operating capital levy**

The operating capital levy calculates what amount the district raises from local property taxes which will help determine how much, if any, equalization is needed.

*cexlvy*

To get the value of this column you calculate the following;

cexlvy = (ocexrev x cexrto)

* ocexrev = operating capital revenue
* cexrto = Less of 1 or (ANTC/APU) / $23,885  (this is the ratio mentioned in Subd. 13a.Operating capital levy.)

**Operating Capital Aid**

This is the final aid distributed to districts as the equalization measure. 

*cexaid*

To get the value of this column you calculate the following;

cexaid = ocexrev - cexlvy

* ocexrev = operating capital revenue
* cexlvy = operating capital levy

The table below provides all of these values. Out of the `r nrow(filter(original, group %in% c(1,4)))` total schools, `r nrow(filter(original, group %in% c(1,4) & cexaid > 0))` receive operating capital aid. That's nearly every school. 

<br>

```{r operating capital district}
op.cap.dist <- original %>%
  filter(group %in% c(1,4)) %>%
  select(`District Name`, dist, type, group, ageidx22, awadm22, cxfrev, ywadm22, cxfrev, ocexrev, ocexrev, cexrto, cexlvy, cexaid)

datatable(op.cap.dist, class = "cell-border stripe", filter = "top", rownames = FALSE,
          options = list(columnDefs = list(list(className = "dt-center", targets = 1:11)),
                         scrollX = TRUE)) %>%
  formatCurrency(5, "", digits = 4) %>%
  formatCurrency(6, "", digits = 0) %>%
  formatCurrency(7, "$", digits = 2) %>%
  formatCurrency(8, "", digits = 0) %>%
  formatCurrency(9, "$", digits = 2) %>%
  formatCurrency(10, "", digits = 4) %>%
  formatCurrency(11:12, "$", digits = 2)

```

<br>

Here is a list of the schools that did not receive any operating capital aid.

```{r operating capital districts not receiving aid}
op.cap.no.aid.districts <- original %>%
  filter(group %in% c(1,4),
         cexaid == 0) %>%
  select(`District Name`, dist, type, group, ageidx22, awadm22, cxfrev, ywadm22, cxfrev, ocexrev, ocexrev, cexrto, cexlvy, cexaid)

datatable(op.cap.no.aid.districts, class = "cell-border stripe", filter = "top", rownames = FALSE,
          options = list(columnDefs = list(list(className = "dt-center", targets = 1:11)),
                         scrollX = TRUE)) %>%
  formatCurrency(5, "", digits = 4) %>%
  formatCurrency(6, "", digits = 0) %>%
  formatCurrency(7, "$", digits = 2) %>%
  formatCurrency(8, "", digits = 0) %>%
  formatCurrency(9, "$", digits = 2) %>%
  formatCurrency(10, "", digits = 4) %>%
  formatCurrency(11:12, "$", digits = 2)

## Operating capital aid per APU{.tabset}

Now let's check to see what kind of differences exist depending on the type of school, RUCA category, and regions.

Let's begin with looking at differences in operating capital aid by type of school. The table below shows that charter schools receive a bit more operating capital aid per APU than public schools - $188 vs. $130.06.

<br>

```{r operating capital per apu group}
op.cap.apu.group <- original %>%
  filter(group %in% c(1,4),
         cexaid > 0) %>%
  group_by(group) %>%
  summarize(awadm22 = sum(awadm22),
            cexaid = sum(cexaid)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(op.cap.aid.apu = cexaid / awadm22) %>%
  left_join(group.codes, by = c("group" = "Code")) %>%
  select(Definition, awadm22, cexaid, op.cap.aid.apu)

datatable(op.cap.apu.group, class = "cell-border stripe", filter = "top", rownames = FALSE,
          options = list(columnDefs = list(list(className = "dt-center", targets = 1:3)))) %>%
  formatCurrency(2, "", digits = 0) %>%
  formatCurrency(3:4, "$")

```

<br>

Now let's check the RUCA categories and regions.

The RUCA categories provide some interesting results. Entirely rural counties receive the least amount of operating capital aid per APU at $89.06. This is quite a bit less than the next lowest which is town/rural mix schools at $132.24. Interestingly, urban/town/rural mix schools receive, by far, the most with $146.65 per APU.

The planning regions breakdown shows that Southwest receive the largest amount with $118 per APU followed closed by seven county metro with $130. The highest exists in Central with $153.

The EDR breakdowns show that one of our most rural EDRs receives the lowest operating capital per APU which is EDR 6W with $96. This is followed by a bunch of southwest regions such as EDR 8, 9, and 4 which range from $109 to $128. The highest is EDR 7E with $158.36. 

<br>

### RUCA

<br>

```{r operating capital per apu ruca}

  summarize(awadm22 = sum(awadm22),
            cexaid = sum(cexaid)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(op.cap.aid.apu = cexaid / awadm22)

datatable(op.cap.apu.ruca, class = "cell-border stripe", filter = "top", rownames = FALSE,
          options = list(columnDefs = list(list(className = "dt-center", targets = 1:3)))) %>%

            cexaid = sum(cexaid)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(op.cap.aid.apu = cexaid / awadm22)

datatable(op.cap.apu.pr, class = "cell-border stripe", filter = "top", rownames = FALSE,
          options = list(columnDefs = list(list(className = "dt-center", targets = 1:3)))) %>%

```

# {.unnumbered .unlisted .toc-ignore .tabset}

Let's check it out by county. The map below provides the operating capital aid per APU for all schools that received aid in each county. It clearly shows that schools along the 94 corridor receive the highest aid per APU. Some of the lowest aid per APU is in Southwest Minnesota. But why? 

```{r operating capital per apu county}
