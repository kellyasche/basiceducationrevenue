class="section level1">
<h1>4% increase across all components - overview</h1>
<p>There are multiple ways in which legislators can change the general
education revenue formula. However, it is typical that legislators will
increase difference funding mechanisms by percentages. For example, the
legislature can increase the basic education revenue by 4%. In FY22 that
would mean the revenue would jump from 6728 to 6997.12.</p>
<p>Interestingly, other components of the general education revenue
formula are dependent on the the basic education revenue value. For
example, the declining enrollment component provides additional revenues
for districts with decreasing enrollment by providing 28% of the basic
education revenue value multiplied by the difference between FY22 and
FY21 APUs. The components that are linked to the basic education revenue
component are;</p>
<ul>
<li>Declining enrollment</li>
<li>Compensatory</li>
<li>Sparsity,</li>
<li>Transportation sparsity, and</li>
<li>Options adjustment.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the flip side of all this, the legislature could also choose other
elements to adjust, such as increasing the gifted and talented revenue
from $13 to $14 per APU.</p>
<p>In this analysis, we are going to keep it simple in order to see what
a 4% increase across all the elements within each component to determine
what has the most impact and if there’s a difference in the geography
and type of school.</p>
<p>The following is a list of all the components and how each one was
adjusted by 4%.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Basic education revenue</strong></p>
<p>The basic education revenue category provides a base amount of
revenue per adjusted pupil units to each school district.</p>
<p>A 4% would bring the revenue from $6,728 to $6,997.12.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Extended time</strong></p>
<p>This program allows a school district to count a student who
participates in extended programming for up to an additional 0.2
students in ADM for the time the student spends in summer school, etc….
The allowance is $5,117 X the district’s extended time adjusted pupil
units.</p>
<p>A 4% increase would bring the revenue from $5,117 to $5,321.68.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Gifted and talented</strong></p>
<p>A school district receives $13 per pupil unit for gifted and talented
programming. $13 X adjusted pupil units. Must be spent on gifted and
talented students.</p>
<p>A 4% increase would bring the revenue from $13 to $13.52.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Small schools</strong></p>
<p>A school district that serves less than 960 pupil units is eligible
for small schools revenue equal to $544 X the district’s adjusted pupil
units, times the ratio of 960 less the district’s adjusted pupil units
to 960.</p>
<p>A 4% increase would bring the revenue from $544 to $565.76.</p>
<p>In addition, a few schools received a dollar amount that wasn’t in
the usual $544 x APU ratio due to having multiple schools in the
district. A few of the schools in these districts qualified for small
schools funding. Each of these were also increased.</p>
<ul>
<li>District 318, from $70,189.06 to $72,996.56,</li>
<li>District 363, from $115,058.66 to $119,661,</li>
<li>District 381, from $241,346.69 to $251,001,</li>
<li>District 2142, from $404,349.22 to $420,523.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Declining enrollment</strong></p>
<p>Revenue equals the greater of zero or 28% of the formula allowance
for that year and the difference between adjusted pupil units for the
current year and the adjusted pupil units for the previous year.</p>
<p>A 4% increase would bring the revenue from $1,884 to $1,959.36.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Local optional aid</strong></p>
<p>This revenue is meant to help equalize property rich schools
districts and property poor school districts by providing extra aid to
property poor districts. This is done by calculating the revenue, then
the levy with equalizing factors, and then aid is distributed by
subtracting the levy from the revenue.</p>
<ul>
<li>Revenue
<ul>
<li>Tier 1: from $300 to $312</li>
<li>Tier 2: $424 to $440.96</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Levy equalizing factors
<ul>
<li>Tier 1: $880,000 to $915,200</li>
<li>Tier 2: $510,000 to $530,400</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Compensatory</strong></p>
<p>Compensatory is a site-based revenue and at least 50% of the revenue
must be distributed to qualifying programs at each site. The revenue
must be used to meet the educational needs of pupils whose progress
toward meeting state or local content or performance standards is below
the level that is appropriate for learners of their age. This revenue
must be put into a separate account. Revenue increases as the number of
compensatory pupil units goes up, which is driven by the number of free
and reduced price meals.</p>
<p>A pupil is counted as compensatory pupil if the pupil is eligible for
free or reduced priced meals, which is set by the Federal government at
130% and 185 % of the federal poverty guidelines.</p>
<ul>
<li>Compensatory Revenue = (Basic Formula Allowance - $839) x .6 x
Compensatory Pupil Units</li>
<li>Compensatory Pupil Units = (free lunch students + .5 x reduced lunch
students) x the less of: one, or (free lunch students + .5 x reduced
lunch students) / building ADM / .8</li>
</ul>
<p>A 4% increase in this funding is linked to the basic education
revenue so it would be $5,889 to $6,124.56. However, we were not
provided the number of students that qualified for free or reduced lunch
at each district but rather just given the total compensatory value for
each school district. So in this case, we just increased the total
dollar amount by 4%.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>English learners</strong></p>
<p>English learner revenue: a school district with at least one student
eligible for EL services has a statutorily assigned minimum EL pupil
count of 20. In addition, a district received more english learner
revenue depending on the concentration of english learner students
within the district.</p>
<p>A 4% increase for the basic EL revenue would go from $704 to
$732.16.</p>
<p>A 4% increase for EL concentration revenue would go from $250 to
$260.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Sparsity</strong></p>
<p>This is a vertical funding mechanism meant to shore up support for
school districts that serve small student population for an area not
served by other schools. It acknowledges the challenges associated with
the lack of economies of scale to providing education.</p>
<p>There are three parts to this revenue;</p>
<ul>
<li>Secondary school sparsity</li>
<li>Elementary school sparsity</li>
<li>Sparsity guarantee</li>
</ul>
<p>The two main components that can be changed are the following;</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic education revenue - $530: a 4% increase goes from $6,198.00 to
$6,445.92.</li>
<li>Elementary sparsity revenue: the total revenue received by each
school district was provided so we just multiplied the total revenue by
4%.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Operating Capital aid</strong></p>
<p>Operating capital revenue must be reserved and used for equipment and
facility needs. The computation is, the sum of $79 per pupil unit and
the product of $109 per pupil unit and the district’s average building
age index. The age index is called the maintenance cost index (MCI) and
is calculated as follows;</p>
<ul>
<li>MCI = (weighted square footage of buildings) / (Unweighted square
footage of buildings)</li>
<li>The weighted square food is the buildings square footage times the
lesser of 1.5 or the sum of 1 + (the age of each building or addition /
100).</li>
</ul>
<p>Operating capital revenue is provided through an equalized aid and
levy and is computed as follows;</p>
<ul>
<li>Operating capital revenue - [$79 + (MCI x $109)] x adjusted pupil
units</li>
<li>Operating capital levy = Operating capital revenue x the less of 1
or (adjusted net tax capacity /Adjusted Pupil Units) / $23,885</li>
<li>Operating capital aid = Operating Capital Revenue - Operating
Capital Levy</li>
</ul>
<p>The following adjustments were made for this scenario;</p>
<p>A 4% increase of $79 is $82.16.</p>
<p>A 4% increase of $109 is $113.36.</p>
<p>A 4% increase for the equalizing factor goes from $23,885 to
$24,840.40.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Transportation sparsity</strong></p>
<p>Transportation sparsity revenue provides revenue to school districts
that have a relatively low ratio of pupils to the square mile area of
the school district.</p>
<p>the primary change here is the increase in the basic education
revenue.</p>
<p>A 4% would bring the revenue from $6,728 to $6,997.12.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Equity</strong></p>
<p>Equity revenue is designed to provide additional revenue to districts
with lower amounts of referendum revenue. Calculations for this revenue
is broken into two regions - the 7-county metro and greater Minnesota.
The formula consists of three parts.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Basic equity revenue: equals the product of 125% x [$14 +($80 x
district’s equity index)] x adjusted pupil units
<ul>
<li>Equity index = 1 - (basic formula allowance + local optional revenue
+ referendum revenue) / per pupil amount for the district at the 95th
percentile in that region</li>
<li>School districts of the first class (Minneapolis, St. Paul, and
Duluth) don’t receive basic equity revenue</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Low referendum revenue: district has per pupil referendum revenue
less than 10% of the statewide average receives an additional equity
amount equal to the lesser of $100,000 or the difference between 10% of
the statewide average referendum revenue and the district’s current
amount of referendum revenue.</li>
<li>Supplemental equity revenue: all school districts receive $50 per
pupil unit.</li>
</ol>
<p>Equity aid and levy: A district’s total equity revenue is equalized
on referendum market value using an equalizing factor of $510,000.</p>
<p>The primary change in equity funding in this scenario is;</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic education revenue: from $6,728 to $6,997.12</li>
<li>Updated revenue (4% scenario) from small schools, location optional
referendum, transition revenue, and referendum revenue.</li>
<li>A 4% increase to $14 is $14.56.</li>
<li>A 4% increase to $80 is $83.20.</li>
<li>A 4% increase to $50 is $52.</li>
<li>A 4% increase to the equalizing factor goes from $500,000 to

<h1 class="tabset">Comparing scenarios</h1>
<p>The primary question is what impact does tweaking only specific
components of the general education revenue formula vs. increasing the
entire formula the same amount. That’s what we will analyze below.</p>
<p>The table below provides each school district and compares the
funding they would receive if only the basic education revenue component
was increased vs. increasing the entire general education formula. Also
included are the rank in terms of the difference each scenario makes
over the original funding the district received. For example, increasing
the entire formula by 4% increases the revenue for Mahnomen Public
School districts by 5.43% which is the second highest among all schools,
while only increasing the basic education component by 4% increases that
districts revenue by 4.95% which is third highest among all schools.</p>
<p>It’s a bit difficult to determine what, if any, patterns exist with
so many schools.But, the rankings do look to be relatively close to each
other.</p>

<p>Since it’s a bit difficult to tell with the table, let’s check to see
what the range is of the percentage changes. Below is a chart that
provides the percentage change for each district for each scenario.</p>
<p>For the increase of 4% across the entire formula, the highest change
in revenue is 6.8% for Cook County Public Schools and the lowest is 3.1%
for Greenbush-Middle River School district with 3.1%. This is a range of
3.7 percentage points. For the 4% increase for only the basic education
revenue component, the highest is 6.7% for Cook County Public Schools
and 2.6% for Greenbush. This is a range of 4.1 percentage points.</p>

<p>Next, let’s check the change for public vs. charter schools.</p>
<p>In both scenarios, public schools receive a higher bump in revenue
than charter schools. If the entire formula is increased by 4%, public
schools receive a 4.26% bump compared to charter schools 3.94%. If the
basic education revenue component is increased by 4%, public schools
receive a 3.82% bump compared to charter schools 3.66%.</p>
