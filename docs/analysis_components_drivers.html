<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Analysis - components that drive
differences</h1>

</div>


<div id="section-overview-of-scenarios" class="section level1">
<h1>Overview of scenarios</h1>
<p>The general education formula was developed in order to bring
fairness in eduction funding across school districts independent of
where they are located (property values, etc…) while also acknowledging
that some schools will cost more to operate due to location and
characteristics of the district. By only focusing on increasing one
element of the formula, there is risk of making funding school districts
unbalanced.</p>
<p>There are multiple ways in which legislators can change the general
education revenue formula. However, it is typical that legislators will
increase difference funding mechanisms by percentages. For example, the
legislature can increase the basic education revenue by 4%. In FY22 that
would mean the revenue would jump from 6728 to 6997.12.</p>
<p>One advantage of only increasing the basic education revenue
component is that that component is linked to a few other components.
For example, the declining enrollment component provides additional
revenues for districts with decreasing enrollment by providing 28% of
the basic education revenue value multiplied by the difference between
FY22 and FY21 APUs. The components that are linked to the basic
education revenue component are;</p>
<ul>
<li>Declining enrollment</li>
<li>Compensatory</li>
<li>Sparsity,</li>
<li>Transportation sparsity, and</li>
<li>Options adjustment.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the flip side of all this, the legislature could also choose other
elements to adjust, such as increasing the gifted and talented revenue
from $13 to $14 per APU.</p>
<p>I want to analyze what happens to total revenues for schools when
focusing on one component vs. all components for increases. Therefore
the following scenarios will be compared;</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>4% increase to all components in the formula</li>
<li>4% increase to the basic education revenue component only.</li>
</ol>
<p>This will help us determine if some schools benefit way more by only
focusing on one component for increases rather than the entire
formula.</p>
<p><br></p>
<div id="section-overview-of-scenario-1-4-increase-for-entire-formula"
class="section level2">
<h2>Overview of scenario 1: 4% increase for entire formula</h2>
<p>The following is a list of all the components and how each one was
adjusted by 4%.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Basic education revenue</strong></p>
<p>The basic education revenue category provides a base amount of
revenue per adjusted pupil units to each school district.</p>
<p>A 4% would bring the revenue from $6,728 to $6,997.12.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Extended time</strong></p>
<p>This program allows a school district to count a student who
participates in extended programming for up to an additional 0.2
students in ADM for the time the student spends in summer school, etc….
The allowance is $5,117 X the district’s extended time adjusted pupil
units.</p>
<p>A 4% increase would bring the revenue from $5,117 to $5,321.68.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Gifted and talented</strong></p>
<p>A school district receives $13 per pupil unit for gifted and talented
programming. $13 X adjusted pupil units. Must be spent on gifted and
talented students.</p>
<p>A 4% increase would bring the revenue from $13 to $13.52.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Small schools</strong></p>
<p>A school district that serves less than 960 pupil units is eligible
for small schools revenue equal to $544 X the district’s adjusted pupil
units, times the ratio of 960 less the district’s adjusted pupil units
to 960.</p>
<p>A 4% increase would bring the revenue from $544 to $565.76.</p>
<p>In addition, a few schools received a dollar amount that wasn’t in
the usual $544 x APU ratio due to having multiple schools in the
district. A few of the schools in these districts qualified for small
schools funding. Each of these were also increased.</p>
<ul>
<li>District 318, from $70,189.06 to $72,996.56,</li>
<li>District 363, from $115,058.66 to $119,661,</li>
<li>District 381, from $241,346.69 to $251,001,</li>
<li>District 2142, from $404,349.22 to $420,523.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Declining enrollment</strong></p>
<p>Revenue equals the greater of zero or 28% of the formula allowance
for that year and the difference between adjusted pupil units for the
current year and the adjusted pupil units for the previous year.</p>
<p>A 4% increase would bring the revenue from $1,884 to $1,959.36.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Local optional aid</strong></p>
<p>This revenue is meant to help equalize property rich schools
districts and property poor school districts by providing extra aid to
property poor districts. This is done by calculating the revenue, then
the levy with equalizing factors, and then aid is distributed by
subtracting the levy from the revenue.</p>
<ul>
<li>Revenue
<ul>
<li>Tier 1: from $300 to $312</li>
<li>Tier 2: $424 to $440.96</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Levy equalizing factors
<ul>
<li>Tier 1: $880,000 to $915,200</li>
<li>Tier 2: $510,000 to $530,400</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Compensatory</strong></p>
<p>Compensatory is a site-based revenue and at least 50% of the revenue
must be distributed to qualifying programs at each site. The revenue
must be used to meet the educational needs of pupils whose progress
toward meeting state or local content or performance standards is below
the level that is appropriate for learners of their age. This revenue
must be put into a separate account. Revenue increases as the number of
compensatory pupil units goes up, which is driven by the number of free
and reduced price meals.</p>
<p>A pupil is counted as compensatory pupil if the pupil is eligible for
free or reduced priced meals, which is set by the Federal government at
130% and 185 % of the federal poverty guidelines.</p>
<ul>
<li>Compensatory Revenue = (Basic Formula Allowance - $839) x .6 x
Compensatory Pupil Units</li>
<li>Compensatory Pupil Units = (free lunch students + .5 x reduced lunch
students) x the less of: one, or (free lunch students + .5 x reduced
lunch students) / building ADM / .8</li>
</ul>
<p>A 4% increase in this funding is linked to the basic education
revenue so it would be $5,889 to $6,124.56. However, we were not
provided the number of students that qualified for free or reduced lunch
at each district but rather just given the total compensatory value for
each school district. So in this case, we just increased the total
dollar amount by 4%.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>English learners</strong></p>
<p>English learner revenue: a school district with at least one student
eligible for EL services has a statutorily assigned minimum EL pupil
count of 20. In addition, a district received more english learner
revenue depending on the concentration of english learner students
within the district.</p>
<p>A 4% increase for the basic EL revenue would go from $704 to
$732.16.</p>
<p>A 4% increase for EL concentration revenue would go from $250 to
$260.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Sparsity</strong></p>
<p>This is a vertical funding mechanism meant to shore up support for
school districts that serve small student population for an area not
served by other schools. It acknowledges the challenges associated with
the lack of economies of scale to providing education.</p>
<p>There are three parts to this revenue;</p>
<ul>
<li>Secondary school sparsity</li>
<li>Elementary school sparsity</li>
<li>Sparsity guarantee</li>
</ul>
<p>The two main components that can be changed are the following;</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic education revenue - $530: a 4% increase goes from $6,198.00 to
$6,445.92.</li>
<li>Elementary sparsity revenue: the total revenue received by each
school district was provided so we just multiplied the total revenue by
4%.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Operating Capital aid</strong></p>
<p>Operating capital revenue must be reserved and used for equipment and
facility needs. The computation is, the sum of $79 per pupil unit and
the product of $109 per pupil unit and the district’s average building
age index. The age index is called the maintenance cost index (MCI) and
is calculated as follows;</p>
<ul>
<li>MCI = (weighted square footage of buildings) / (Unweighted square
footage of buildings)</li>
<li>The weighted square food is the buildings square footage times the
lesser of 1.5 or the sum of 1 + (the age of each building or addition /
100).</li>
</ul>
<p>Operating capital revenue is provided through an equalized aid and
levy and is computed as follows;</p>
<ul>
<li>Operating capital revenue - [$79 + (MCI x $109)] x adjusted pupil
units</li>
<li>Operating capital levy = Operating capital revenue x the less of 1
or (adjusted net tax capacity /Adjusted Pupil Units) / $23,885</li>
<li>Operating capital aid = Operating Capital Revenue - Operating
Capital Levy</li>
</ul>
<p>The following adjustments were made for this scenario;</p>
<p>A 4% increase of $79 is $82.16.</p>
<p>A 4% increase of $109 is $113.36.</p>
<p>A 4% increase for the equalizing factor goes from $23,885 to
$24,840.40.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Transportation sparsity</strong></p>
<p>Transportation sparsity revenue provides revenue to school districts
that have a relatively low ratio of pupils to the square mile area of
the school district.</p>
<p>the primary change here is the increase in the basic education
revenue.</p>
<p>A 4% would bring the revenue from $6,728 to $6,997.12.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Equity</strong></p>
<p>Equity revenue is designed to provide additional revenue to districts
with lower amounts of referendum revenue. Calculations for this revenue
is broken into two regions - the 7-county metro and greater Minnesota.
The formula consists of three parts.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Basic equity revenue: equals the product of 125% x [$14 +($80 x
district’s equity index)] x adjusted pupil units
<ul>
<li>Equity index = 1 - (basic formula allowance + local optional revenue
+ referendum revenue) / per pupil amount for the district at the 95th
percentile in that region</li>
<li>School districts of the first class (Minneapolis, St. Paul, and
Duluth) don’t receive basic equity revenue</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Low referendum revenue: district has per pupil referendum revenue
less than 10% of the statewide average receives an additional equity
amount equal to the lesser of $100,000 or the difference between 10% of
the statewide average referendum revenue and the district’s current
amount of referendum revenue.</li>
<li>Supplemental equity revenue: all school districts receive $50 per
pupil unit.</li>
</ol>
<p>Equity aid and levy: A district’s total equity revenue is equalized
on referendum market value using an equalizing factor of $510,000.</p>
<p>The primary change in equity funding in this scenario is;</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic education revenue: from $6,728 to $6,997.12</li>
<li>Updated revenue (4% scenario) from small schools, location optional
referendum, transition revenue, and referendum revenue.</li>
<li>A 4% increase to $14 is $14.56.</li>
<li>A 4% increase to $80 is $83.20.</li>
<li>A 4% increase to $50 is $52.</li>
<li>A 4% increase to the equalizing factor goes from $500,000 to
$520,000.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Transition</strong></p>
<p>No changes were made to this revenue.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Pension adjustment</strong></p>
<p>No changes were made to the pension adjustment.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Options adjustment</strong></p>
<p>The change here was in the basic education revenue allotment.</p>
<p>A 4% increase goes from $6728 to $6,997.12.</p>

<h2>Overview of scenario 2: 4% increase to basic education revenue
component</h2>
<p>Due to the basic education revenue component being linked to other
components, it’s important to understand what changes.</p>
<p>The following is a list of the components that are impacted by a 4%
increase to only the basic education revenue component.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Declining enrollment</strong></p>
<p>Revenue equals the greater of zero or 28% of the formula allowance
for that year and the difference between adjusted pupil units for the
current year and the adjusted pupil units for the previous year.</p>
<p>A 4% increase would bring the revenue from $1,884 to $1,959.36.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Compensatory</strong></p>
<p>Compensatory is a site-based revenue and at least 50% of the revenue
must be distributed to qualifying programs at each site. The revenue
must be used to meet the educational needs of pupils whose progress
toward meeting state or local content or performance standards is below
the level that is appropriate for learners of their age. This revenue
must be put into a separate account. Revenue increases as the number of
compensatory pupil units goes up, which is driven by the number of free
and reduced price meals.</p>
<p>A pupil is counted as compensatory pupil if the pupil is eligible for
free or reduced priced meals, which is set by the Federal government at
130% and 185 % of the federal poverty guidelines.</p>
<ul>
<li>Compensatory Revenue = (Basic Formula Allowance - $839) x .6 x
Compensatory Pupil Units</li>
<li>Compensatory Pupil Units = (free lunch students + .5 x reduced lunch
students) x the less of: one, or (free lunch students + .5 x reduced
lunch students) / building ADM / .8</li>
</ul>
<p>A 4% increase in this funding is linked to the basic education
revenue so it would be $5,889 to $6,124.56. However, we were not
provided the number of students that qualified for free or reduced lunch
at each district but rather just given the total compensatory value for
each school district. So in this case, we just increased the total
dollar amount by 4%.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Sparsity</strong></p>
<p>This is a vertical funding mechanism meant to shore up support for
school districts that serve small student population for an area not
served by other schools. It acknowledges the challenges associated with
the lack of economies of scale to providing education.</p>
<p>There are three parts to this revenue;</p>
<ul>
<li>Secondary school sparsity</li>
<li>Elementary school sparsity</li>
<li>Sparsity guarantee</li>
</ul>
<p>The two main components that can be changed are the following;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Basic education revenue - $530: a 4% increase goes from $6,198.00
to $6,445.92.</p></li>
<li><p>Elementary sparsity revenue: the total revenue received by each
school district was provided so we just multiplied the total elementary
sparsity revenue provided by 4%.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Transportation sparsity</strong></p>
<p>Transportation sparsity revenue provides revenue to school districts
that have a relatively low ratio of pupils to the square mile area of
the school district.</p>
<p>the primary change here is the increase in the basic education
revenue.</p>
<p>A 4% would bring the revenue from $6,728 to $6,997.12.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Options adjustment</strong></p>
<p>The change here was in the basic education revenue allotment.</p>
<p>A 4% increase goes from $6728 to $6,997.12.</p>
