<div id="section-increase-across-all-components---overview"
class="section level1">
<h1>1% increase across all components - overview</h1>
<p>There are multiple ways in which legislators can change the general
education revenue formula. However, it is typical that legislators will
increase difference funding mechanisms by percentages. For example, the
legislature can increase the basic education revenue by 1%. In FY22 that
would mean the revenue would jump from 6728 to 6795.28.</p>
<p>Interestingly, other components of the general education revenue
formula are dependent on the the basic education revenue value. For
example, the declining enrollment component provides additional revenues
for districts with decreasing enrollment by providing 28% of the basic
education revenue value multiplied by the difference between FY22 and
FY21 APUs. The components that are linked to the basic education revenue
component are;</p>
<ul>
<li>Declining enrollment</li>
<li>Compensatory</li>
<li>Sparsity,</li>
<li>Transportation sparsity, and</li>
<li>Options adjustment.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the flip side of all this, the legislature could also choose other
elements to adjust, such as increasing the gifted and talented revenue
from $13 to $14 per APU.</p>
<p>In this analysis, we are going to keep it simple in order to see what
a 1% increase across all the elements within each component to determine
what has the most impact and if there’s a difference in the geography
and type of school.</p>
<p>The following is a list of all the components and how each one was
adjusted by 1%.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Basic education revenue</strong></p>
<p>The basic education revenue category provides a base amount of
revenue per adjusted pupil units to each school district.</p>
<p>A 1% would bring the revenue from $6,728 to $6,795.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Extended time</strong></p>
<p>This program allows a school district to count a student who
participates in extended programming for up to an additional 0.2
students in ADM for the time the student spends in summer school, etc….
The allowance is $5,117 X the district’s extended time adjusted pupil
units.</p>
<p>A 1% increase would bring the revenue from $5,117 to $5,168</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Gifted and talented</strong></p>
<p>A school district receives $13 per pupil unit for gifted and talented
programming. $13 X adjusted pupil units. Must be spent on gifted and
talented students.</p>
<p>A 1% increase would bring the revenue from $13 to $13. There would be
no change. So let’s bring this up $1 to $14. This would be a more
accurate depiction of how the legislature would make a change for this
component.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Small schools</strong></p>
<p>A school district that serves less than 960 pupil units is eligible
for small schools revenue equal to $544 X the district’s adjusted pupil
units, times the ratio of 960 less the district’s adjusted pupil units
to 960.</p>
<p>A 1% increase would bring the revenue from $544 to $549.</p>
<p>In addition, a few schools received a dollar amount that wasn’t in
the usual $544 x APU ratio due to having multiple schools in the
district. A few of the schools in these districts qualified for small
schools funding. Each of these were also increased.</p>
<ul>
<li>District 318, from $70,189.06 to $70,890.95,</li>
<li>District 363, from $115,058.66 to $116,209.20,</li>
<li>District 381, from $241,346.69 to $243,760.20,</li>
<li>District 2142, from $404,349.22 to $408,392.70.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Declining enrollment</strong></p>
<p>Revenue equals the greater of zero or 28% of the formula allowance
for that year and the difference between adjusted pupil units for the
current year and the adjusted pupil units for the previous year.</p>
<p>A 1* increase would bring the revenue from $1,884 to $1,903.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Local optional aid</strong></p>
<p>This revenue is meant to help equalize property rich schools
districts and property poor school districts by providing extra aid to
property poor districts. This is done by calculating the revenue, then
the levy with equalizing factors, and then aid is distributed by
subtracting the levy from the revenue.</p>
<ul>
<li>Revenue
<ul>
<li>Tier 1: from $300 to $303</li>
<li>Tier 2: $424 to $428</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Levy equalizing factors
<ul>
<li>Tier 1: $880,000 to $888,800</li>
<li>Tier 2: $510,000 to $515,100</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Compensatory</strong></p>
<p>Compensatory is a site-based revenue and at least 50% of the revenue
must be distributed to qualifying programs at each site. The revenue
must be used to meet the educational needs of pupils whose progress
toward meeting state or local content or performance standards is below
the level that is appropriate for learners of their age. This revenue
must be put into a separate account. Revenue increases as the number of
compensatory pupil units goes up, which is driven by the number of free
and reduced price meals.</p>
<p>A pupil is counted as compensatory pupil if the pupil is eligible for
free or reduced priced meals, which is set by the Federal government at
130% and 185 % of the federal poverty guidelines.</p>
<ul>
<li>Compensatory Revenue = (Basic Formula Allowance - $839) x .6 x
Compensatory Pupil Units</li>
<li>Compensatory Pupil Units = (free lunch students + .5 x reduced lunch
students) x the less of: one, or (free lunch students + .5 x reduced
lunch students) / building ADM / .8</li>
</ul>
<p>A 1% increase in this funding is linked to the basic education
revenue so it would be $5,889 to $5,956. However, we were not provided
the number of students that qualified for free or reduced lunch at each
district but rather just given the total compensatory value for each
school district. So in this case, we just increased the total dollar
amount by 1%.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>English learners</strong></p>
<p>English learner revenue: a school district with at least one student
eligible for EL services has a statutorily assigned minimum EL pupil
count of 20. In addition, a district received more english learner
revenue depending on the concentration of english learner students
within the district.</p>
<p>A 1% increase for the basic EL revenue would go from $704 to
$711.</p>
<p>A 1% increase for EL concentration revenue would go from $250 to
$253.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Sparsity</strong></p>
<p>This is a vertical funding mechanism meant to shore up support for
school districts that serve small student population for an area not
served by other schools. It acknowledges the challenges associated with
the lack of economies of scale to providing education.</p>
<p>There are three parts to this revenue;</p>
<ul>
<li>Secondary school sparsity</li>
<li>Elementary school sparsity</li>
<li>Sparsity guarantee</li>
</ul>
<p>The two main components that can be changed are the following;</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic education revenue - $530: a 1% increase goes from $6,198.00 to
$6,265.28.</li>
<li>Elementary sparsity revenue: the total revenue received by each
school district was provided so we just multiplied the total revenue by
1%.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Operating Capital aid</strong></p>
<p>Operating capital revenue must be reserved and used for equipment and
facility needs. The computation is, the sum of $79 per pupil unit and
the product of $109 per pupil unit and the district’s average building
age index. The age index is called the maintenance cost index (MCI) and
is calculated as follows;</p>
<ul>
<li>MCI = (weighted square footage of buildings) / (Unweighted square
footage of buildings)</li>
<li>The weighted square food is the buildings square footage times the
lesser of 1.5 or the sum of 1 + (the age of each building or addition /
100).</li>
</ul>
<p>Operating capital revenue is provided through an equalized aid and
levy and is computed as follows;</p>
<ul>
<li>Operating capital revenue - [$79 + (MCI x $109)] x adjusted pupil
units</li>
<li>Operating capital levy = Operating capital revenue x the less of 1
or (adjusted net tax capacity /Adjusted Pupil Units) / $23,885</li>
<li>Operating capital aid = Operating Capital Revenue - Operating
Capital Levy</li>
</ul>
<p>The following adjustments were made for this scenario;</p>
<p>A 1% increase of $79 is $80.</p>
<p>A 1% increase of $109 is $110.</p>
<p>A 1% increase for the equalizing factor goes from $23,885 to
$24,124.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Transportation sparsity</strong></p>
<p>Transportation sparsity revenue provides revenue to school districts
that have a relatively low ratio of pupils to the square mile area of
the school district.</p>
<p>the primary change here is the increase in the basic education
revenue.</p>
<p>A 1% would bring the revenue from $6,728 to $6,795.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Equity</strong></p>
<p>Equity revenue is designed to provide additional revenue to districts
with lower amounts of referendum revenue. Calculations for this revenue
is broken into two regions - the 7-county metro and greater Minnesota.
The formula consists of three parts.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Basic equity revenue: equals the product of 125% x [$14 +($80 x
district’s equity index)] x adjusted pupil units
<ul>
<li>Equity index = 1 - (basic formula allowance + local optional revenue
+ referendum revenue) / per pupil amount for the district at the 95th
percentile in that region</li>
<li>School districts of the first class (Minneapolis, St. Paul, and
Duluth) don’t receive basic equity revenue</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Low referendum revenue: district has per pupil referendum revenue
less than 10% of the statewide average receives an additional equity
amount equal to the lesser of $100,000 or the difference between 10% of
the statewide average referendum revenue and the district’s current
amount of referendum revenue.</li>
<li>Supplemental equity revenue: all school districts receive $50 per
pupil unit.</li>
</ol>
<p>Equity aid and levy: A district’s total equity revenue is equalized
on referendum market value using an equalizing factor of $510,000.</p>
<p>The primary change in equity funding in this scenario is;</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic education revenue: from $6,728 to $6,795</li>
<li>Updated revenue (1% scenario) from small schools, location optional
referendum, transition revenue, and referendum revenue.</li>
<li>A 1% increase to $14 is $14.</li>
<li>A 1% increase to $80 is $81.</li>
<li>A 1% increase to $50 is $51.</li>
<li>A 1% increase to the equalizing factor goes from $500,000 to
$515,100.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Transition</strong></p>
<p>No changes were made to this revenue.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Pension adjustment</strong></p>
<p>No changes were made to the pension adjustment.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Options adjustment</strong></p>
<p>The change here was in the basic education revenue allotment.</p>
<p>A 1% increase goes from $6728 to $6,795.</p>

<h2 class="tabset">1% increase across all components - analysis</h2>
<p>The following will provide the change in revenue if all components
were increased by 1% as laid out in the previous section.</p>
<p>The table below provides the total general education revenue for each
district in FY22 as well as the total revenue if all components were
increased by 1% and difference between FY22 and the 1% increase.</p>
<p>If you sort the districts by the highest change, it’s interesting to
see that most of the schools that experienced the largest increase in
total revenue due to a 1% change in all components are outside of the
seven county metro and rather rural.</p>

<p>Let’s see what this looks like between types of schools (charter
vs. public). When broken down this way, public schools see a bit larger
of a change 1.06% in total revenue increase overe FY22 compared to
charter schools .99%.</p>

<p>Now let’s see what it looks like by RUCA categories as well as
regions.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the RUCA category table shows that the highest
percentage change with the 1% increase occurs for schools located in
urban/town/rural mix counties and town/rural mix counties (each 1.07%).
Entirely rural schools receive a 1.05% increase and entirely urban
receive 1.04%.</p>
<p>The planning region table shows that schools in southern Minnesota
and Central receive the highest increase with 1.07% followed by
Northwest with 1.06% and Northeast and Seven County metro with
1.04%.</p>
<p>The EDR table follows a similar pattern where EDRs located in
Southern and Central Minnesota all have a change of 1.07%. The lowest is
up in Northern Minnesota and seven county meetro.</p>

<h1>1% increase basic education revenue only - overview</h1>
<p>Since there are multiply components that rely on the alloted value of
the basic education revenue component, let’s see who benefits if only
that piece is increased by 1%. The components that are linked to the
basic education revenue component are;</p>
<ul>
<li>Declining enrollment</li>
<li>Compensatory</li>
<li>Sparsity,</li>
<li>Transportation sparsity, and</li>
<li>Options adjustment.</li>
</ul>
<p>So for this analysis the only change that will be made is a 1%
increase in the basic education revenue - from $6,728 to $6,795.</p>
<p><br></p>
<div id="section-increase-basic-education-revenue-only---analysis"
class="section level2 tabset">
<h2 class="tabset">1% increase basic education revenue only -
analysis</h2>
<p>The table below provides the total general education revenue for each
district in FY22 as well as the total revenue if all components were
increased by 1% and difference between FY22 and the 1% increase.</p>
<p>If you sort the districts by the highest change, it’s interesting to
see that most of the schools that experienced the largest increase in
total revenue due to a 1% change in only the basic education revenue
allotment.</p>

<p>The tables below provide a different story than the increases we see
when all components are increased by 1%.</p>
<p>The RUCA table shows that schools located in entirely rural counties
see the lowest bump in revenue if only basic education revenue allotment
is increased - .91% compared to entirely urban which gets the highest
bump of .94%.</p>
<p>When broken down by planning region, the seven county metro sees the
highest bump with a .94% increase compared to Southwest which receives
.92% bump.</p>
<p>Our most rural EDRs also experience the lowest bump - EDR 1, 6W and 8
all get a bump of .91%. The highest bumps got to the seven county metro
and EDRs throughout central Minnesota.</p>

<h1 class="tabset">Driver of differences</h1>
<p>So it’s clear that if only the basic education revenue allotment is
increased, districts in more urban areas receive a larger bump. Why?</p>
<p>Let’s compare the two scenarios and see what’s providing the largest
bump. The table below provides the following data;</p>
<ul>
<li>Categories: the general education revenue component</li>
<li>revenue.1pct: the revenue of that component with a 1% increase
across all components</li>
<li>revenuebsrevonly.1pct: the revenue of that category if only basic
education revenue is increased by 1%</li>
<li>category.diff: the difference in revenue between each scenario for
each category</li>
<li>total.1pct: The total revenue received for a 1% increase to all
components</li>
<li>total.bsrevonly.1pct: The total revenue received for a 1% increase
to the basic education revenue only</li>
<li>diff.total.rev: The difference in total revenues between each
scenario</li>
<li>pct.of.diff: how much the difference between the two total revenues
is made up by that particular category.</li>
</ul>
<p>The table below provides all of this information for each school
district. When sorting by rank for each district, there does seem to be
a bit of a patter.</p>
<p>The primary difference between the two scenarios for smaller, rural
schools is the extra boost from local optional aid. This is almost
always ranked #1 as the biggest driver in the difference between the two
scenarios (between 50% and 70% of the difference).</p>
<p>For larger school districts, operating capital is the primary
driver.</p>

<p>Let’s see if there are any significant differences between public
vs. charter.</p>
<p>The table below shows that charter schools rely on 3 to a relatively
equal degree - operating capital aid, small schools revenue, and english
learners revenue each make up nearly 25% of the difference between the
two scenarios.</p>
<p>For school districts, local optional aid was by far the largest
driver making up 44% of the difference between the two scenarios. This
was followed by operating capital aid and gifted and talented with 25%
and 11% respectively.</p>

<p>Okay, now let’s see what this looks like across RUCA categories and
regions.</p>
<p>The table below shows that all RUCA categories share the same primary
driver of the difference between the two scenarios - local optional aid
is #1. For entirely rural, town/rural mix, and urban/town/rural this
category makes up nearly 50% of the difference between the two scenarios
while only being 34% for entirely urban school districts.</p>
<p>Operating capital aid is also in all three RUCA categories. It’s
percentage of the difference varies across the categories though. It’s
ranked third for entirely rural while being 2nd for the remaining. It
varies from making up 30% of the difference for entirely urban and 15%
for entirely rural.</p>
<p>The remaining difference in categories is the small schools revenue
for entirely rural - it comprises 17% of the difference and is ranked
2nd. Entirely urban has gifted and talented as it’s third ranked
category and town/rural mi and urban/town/rural mix each have equity aid
as it’s 3rd ranked category.</p>
<p>The planning region breakdown shows that local optional aid is the
number 1 ranked primary driver in the differences between the two
scenarios. It ranges from 31% for the seven county metro to 52% for
Central Minnesota.</p>
<p>The second ranked category is also shared across all planning regions
- Operating capital aid ranges from 18% in Southwest to 30% for the
seven county metro.</p>
<p>The third ranked category is shared across nearly all of the planning
regions - gifted and talented is third for all regions except Southwest
where equity aid is ranked 3rd.</p>
<p>Just like the planning regions, the first ranked category that drives
the difference between the two scenarios is shared across all EDRs -
local optional aid.</p>
<p>The 2nd category is shared across all EDRs as well - operating
capital aid.</p>
<p>The 3rd category varies across EDRs. In Northwest it’s small schools
while quite a few of the other EDRs have gifted and talented -
especially EDRs that have larger metros in it. Equity Aid also plays a
role for EDRs in southern and Central Minnesota.</p>

<p>Let’s see what this looks like at a county level. The maps below
provide the 3 top categories that drive the difference between the two
scenarios.</p>
<p>The maps below are interesting. Local optional aid is the number 1
category driving the difference between the two categories across every
county except three - Hennepin and Washington where operating capital
aid is number and Cook where small schools revenue is number 1.</p>
<p>For the 2nd ranked driver, operating capital aid is the driver across
nearly all of Minnesota. In the very western edge of Minnesota, small
schools revenue becomes the 2nd ranked driver, english learners is in
Nobles County, Gifted and talented in Hennepin and Lake and local
optional aid in Washington.</p>
<p>The third rank gets a bit more varies. Both equity aid and gifted and
talented are ranked 3rd across much of Minnesota. The central lakes
region in particular and southeast Minnesota have gifted and talented
aid as their third ranked driver while equity aid covers Northwest,
Central, and Southern Minnesota counties. In addition, small schools and
local optional aid play a role in a number of more rural counties in
Southwest and Northwest Minnesota. English learners is also significant
in counties where there are large concentrations of immigrant and
refugree populations.</p>
