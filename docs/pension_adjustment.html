</div>


<p><br></p>
<div id="section-description" class="section level1">
<h1>Description</h1>
<p>Started to compensate for some past legislative changes to the
employer contribution rates to the public employee retirement systems.
There are two parts</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>a fixed amount based on past contribution rate changes, and</li>
<li>beginning in 2019, an amount equal to the TRA employer contribution
rate increases approved by the 2018 legislature.</li>
</ol>
<p>FY22 Pension Adjustment Revenue = 2015 Grandfather amount x (.0084 x
FY21 covered teacher payroll)</p>
<p><br></p>

<div id="section-state-legislation" class="section level1">
<h1>State Legislation</h1>
<p><a
href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/126C.10#stat.126C.10.37">Subd.
37.Pension adjustment revenue.</a></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>A school district’s pension adjustment revenue equals the sum of:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>the greater of zero or the product of:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>the difference between the district’s adjustment under Minnesota
Statutes 2012, section 127A.50, subdivision 1, for fiscal year 2014 per
adjusted pupil unit and the state average adjustment under Minnesota
Statutes 2012, section 127A.50, subdivision 1, for fiscal year 2014 per
adjusted pupil unit; and</li>
<li>the district’s adjusted pupil units for the fiscal year; and</li>
</ol></li>
<li>the product of the salaries paid to district employees who were
members of the Teachers Retirement Association and the St. Paul
Teachers’ Retirement Fund Association for the prior fiscal year and the
district’s pension adjustment rate for the fiscal year. The pension
adjustment rate for Independent School District No. 625, St. Paul,
equals 0.84 percent for fiscal year 2019, 1.67 percent for fiscal year
2020, 1.88 percent for fiscal year 2021, 2.09 percent for fiscal year
2022, 2.3 percent for fiscal year 2023, and 2.5 percent for fiscal year
2024 and later. The pension adjustment rate for all other districts
equals 0.21 percent for fiscal year 2019, 0.42 percent for fiscal year
2020, 0.63 percent for fiscal year 2021, 0.84 percent for fiscal year
2022, 1.05 percent for fiscal year 2023, and 1.25 percent for fiscal
year 2024 and later.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>For fiscal year 2025 and later, the state total pension adjustment
revenue under paragraph (a), clause (2), must not exceed the amount
calculated under paragraph (a), clause (2), for fiscal year 2024. The
commissioner must prorate the pension adjustment revenue under paragraph
(a), clause (2), so as not to exceed the maximum.</li>
<li>Notwithstanding section 123A.26, subdivision 1, a cooperative unit,
as defined in section 123A.24, subdivision 2, qualifies for pension
adjustment revenue under paragraph (a), clause (2), as if it was a
district, and the aid generated by the cooperative unit shall be paid to
the cooperative unit.</li>
</ol>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="section-data" class="section level1">
<h1>Data</h1>
<p>There are two parts to this formula that need to be added
together.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Subd 37(a1): penrev1 = penalo x awadm22)
<ul>
<li>penalo = subd 37(a1i)</li>
<li>awadm22 = adusted pupil units, subd37(a1ii)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Subd 37(a2): penrev2 = penrate22 x pensal21
<ul>
<li>penrate22 = .84%</li>
<li>pensal21 = salaries paid to members of retirement associations in
FY21</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>The total pension adjustment revenue provided to a school district is
then penrev1 + penrev2.</p>
<p>The table below provides all of these variables. Out of the 515
schools, 499 receive pension adjustment revenue. That’s nearly every
school.</p>
