<h1>Description</h1>
<p>Operating capital revenue must be reserved and used for equipment and
facility needs. The computation is, the sum of $79 per pupil unit and
the product of $109 per pupil unit and the district’s average building
age index. The age index is called the maintenance cost index (MCI) and
is calculated as follows;</p>
<ul>
<li>MCI = (weighted square footage of buildings) / (Unweighted square
footage of buildings)</li>
<li>The weighted square food is the bildings square footage times the
lesser of 1.5 or the sum of 1 + (the age of each building or addition /
100).</li>
</ul>
<p>Operating capital revenue is provided through an equalized aid and
levy and is computed as follows</p>
<ul>
<li>Operating capital revenue - [$79 + (MCI x $109)] x adjusted pupil
units</li>
<li>Operating capital levy = Operating capital revenue x the less of 1
or (adjusted net tax capacity /Adjusted Pupil Units) / $23,885</li>
<li>Operating capital aid = Operating Capital Revenue - Operating
Capital Levy</li>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Total operating capital revenue for a district equals the amount
determined under paragraph (b) or (c), plus $79 times the adjusted pupil
units for the school year. The revenue must be placed in a reserved
account in the general fund and may only be used according to
subdivision 14.</li>
<li>Capital revenue for a district equals $109 times the district’s
maintenance cost index times its adjusted pupil units for the school
year.</li>
<li>The revenue for a district that operates a program under section
124D.128, is increased by an amount equal to $31 times the number of
adjusted pupil units served at the site where the program is
implemented.</li>

13a.Operating capital levy.</a></p>
<p>To obtain operating capital revenue, a district may levy an amount
not more than the product of its operating capital revenue for the
fiscal year times the lesser of one or the ratio of its adjusted net tax
capacity per adjusted pupil unit to the operating capital equalizing
factor. The operating capital equalizing factor equals $23,902 for
fiscal year 2020, $23,885 for fiscal year 2021, and $22,912 for fiscal
year 2022 and later.</p>

<h1>Data</h1>
<p>Operating capital aid is an equalization funding mechanism. It’s
broken into a few different parts - revenue, levy, and aid. These are
the main variables in the dataset that represent each part.</p>
<ul>
<li>Operating capital revenue: ocexrev</li>
<li>Operating capital levy: cexlvy</li>
<li>Operating capital aid: cexaid</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Operating capital revenue</em></p>
<p>The operating capital revenue provides revenue for adjusted pupil
units as well as a bit extra for pupils that participate in programs
outside of normal classroom programming (i.e. summer school).</p>
<p><strong>ocexrev</strong></p>
<p>To get the value of this column you calculate the following;</p>
<p>cxfrev = awadm22 x (79 + (109 x ageidx22))</p>
<ul>
<li>awadm22 = adjusted pupil units</li>
<li>ageidx22 = maintenance cost index</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, we need to add the extra $31 for each pupil unit that
participates in programs outside of normal classroom hours (i.e. summer
school).</p>
<p>ocexrev = cxfrev + (31 x ywadm22)</p>
<ul>
<li>ywadm22 = adusted pupil units for extended learning students</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Operating capital levy</em></p>
<p>The operating capital levy calculates what amount the district raises
from local property taxes which will help determine how much, if any,
equalization is needed.</p>
<p><strong>cexlvy</strong></p>
<p>To get the value of this column you calculate the following;</p>
<p>cexlvy = (ocexrev x cexrto)</p>
<ul>
<li>ocexrev = operating capital revenue</li>
<li>cexrto = Less of 1 or (ANTC/APU) / $23,885 (this is the ratio
mentioned in Subd. 13a.Operating capital levy.)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Operating Capital Aid</em></p>
<p>This is the final aid distributed to districts as the equalization
measure.</p>
<p><strong>cexaid</strong></p>
<p>To get the value of this column you calculate the following;</p>
<p>cexaid = ocexrev - cexlvy</p>
<ul>
<li>ocexrev = operating capital revenue</li>
<li>cexlvy = operating capital levy</li>
</ul>
<p>The table below provides all of these values. Out of the 515 total
schools, 485 receive operating capital aid. That’s nearly every
school.</p>
