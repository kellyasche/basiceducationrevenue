<h1>Description</h1>
<p>Beginning in 2004, school districts are prohibited from counting a
student as more than 1.0 in average daily membership, which they used to
do if a student was participating in a learning year program (summer
school, extended day, extended week, etc..). This program allows a
school district to count a student who participates in extended
programming for up to an additional 0.2 students in ADM for the time the
student spends in summer school, etc…. The allowance is $5,117 X the
district’s extended time adjusted pupil units.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>A school district’s extended time revenue is equal to the product
of $5,117 and the sum of the adjusted pupil units of the district for
each pupil in average daily membership in excess of 1.0 and less than
1.2 according to section <a

<li><p>Extended time revenue for pupils placed in an on-site education
program at the Prairie Lakes Education Center or the Lake Park School,
located within the borders of Independent School District No. 347,
Willmar, for instruction provided after the end of the preceding regular
school year and before the beginning of the following regular school
year equals membership hours divided by the minimum annual instructional

<li><p>A school district’s extended time revenue may be used for

academies, and other programming authorized under the learning year
program.</p></li>

<div id="section-data" class="section level1">
<h1>Data</h1>
<p>The distribution ……</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Since the last official data is from 2022, we will use that fiscal
year to analyze the distribution of revenue.</p>
<p>Extended time is a horizontal funding mechanism. Therefore it is
distributed on a per student basis. In this case, it’s based on students
that attend that participates in programs outside of the typical school
day. Therefore, each school district will receive varying amounts
depending on how many students they have participating in these
programs, but on a per student basis, the revenue should equal $5,117
for each school district, RUCA category, and Region.</p>
<p>All the tables below indicate that each district does receive $5,117
per extended time pupil units. However, on just an adjusted pupil unit
basis the revenue does vary. This indicates that schools have varying
proportion of students that are participating in extended learning
programs.</p>
<p>The district table below shows that the districts receiving the most
extended time revenue per APU vary in terms of being metro or rural
districts. The highest is Dover-Eyota with $452 per APU. The other
districts in the top are a mixture of metro and rural districts.</p>

<p>Next I want to determine if there’s any significant differences in
the revenue per APU being distributed. Any differences that are found
would not be due to the model or anything wrong, but rather that there
is variation in the amount of after school programs offered as well as a
varying proportion of students that attend these programs. The question
is, does the variation depend on RUCA category or region?</p>
<p>The following tables will provide;</p>
<ul>
<li>the range of extended time per APU</li>
<li>mean extended time rev per APU</li>
<li>median extended time rev per APU, and</li>
<li>standard deviation of extended time rev per APU.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, below the table I will conduct an ANOVA analysis to
determine if there are any statistically significant differences in the
amount of extended time revenue per APU by RUCA category and region.</p>
